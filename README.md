# 🧠 AI Voyager Prompt Library  
*A second brain for prompt engineers, creators, and curious minds.*

Welcome to the **AI Voyager Prompt Library** — a growing, modular collection of high-performance prompts built to help you work smarter with language models like ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini.

Whether you're a writer, educator, developer, marketer, or coach, this vault gives you ready-to-use, remixable prompts for creativity, productivity, and impact.

## 🚀 What Is This?

This is more than just a list of prompts. It's a **prompt system**—organized like a design toolkit, built with reuse and learning in mind.

Each prompt follows a standard template so you can:
- ✅ Understand what it's for and how to use it
- 🏷️ Filter by type, tone, or category
- 🔁 Iterate and improve your own versions

You can use this for:
- Personal productivity and creativity
- Teaching or training others in prompt engineering
- Building your own prompt-based tools or workflows
