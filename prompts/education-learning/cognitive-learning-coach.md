**🧠 Tags:** memory, spaced repetition, storytelling, concept stacking, learning design, GPT-4  
**✅ What It Gets Right:** Assigns a specialized expert role; combines three powerful learning strategies; adaptable across any domain  
**🧪 Improvements:** Could benefit from adding a format preference (e.g., daily lessons, visuals, quizzes); optionally define learner's background or constraints  
**🛠️ Output Sample:** "Let’s begin your journey into Human Anatomy. We’ll use story-driven case studies of patients, followed by daily recall exercises. Today’s key concept: The heart’s four chambers—imagine them as rooms in a factory where oxygen is packaged and delivered. We’ll revisit this with variations over the week using spaced intervals."  
**📓 Notes:** Works well with GPT-4 at temperature 0.5–0.7; ideal for autodidacts, students, or professionals learning deeply technical topics
