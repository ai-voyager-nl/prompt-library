⚙️ Type: Role-based

🗂️ Category: education-learning

🧠 Tags: memory, spaced repetition, storytelling, concept stacking, learning design, GPT-4

✅ What It Gets Right: Assigns a specialized expert role; combines three powerful learning strategies; adaptable across any domain

🧪 Improvements: Could benefit from adding a format preference (e.g., daily lessons, visuals, quizzes); optionally define learner's background or constraints

🛠️ Output Sample: >
  "Let’s begin your journey into Human Anatomy. We’ll use story-driven case studies of patients, followed by daily recall exercises. Today’s key concept: The heart’s four chambers—imagine them as rooms in a factory where oxygen is packaged and delivered. We’ll revisit this with variations over the week using spaced intervals."

📓 Notes: Works well with GPT-4 at temperature 0.5–0.7; ideal for autodidacts, students, or professionals learning deeply technical topics
